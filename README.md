# Line-Breaker Package

An [Atom](http://atom.io/) plugin that breaks long lines of text.

Keybindings:
* `alt-cmd-enter` breaks the selected lines or the current line.

Breaks long lines on the preferred line length boundaries while keeping the indentation
of the first line in place.

Works well with contiguous selections of text or long single lines of text.

**TODO**
* Add unit tests
* Maybe allow for newlines to be preserved in the text? Not sure.
